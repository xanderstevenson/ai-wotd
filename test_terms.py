At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\n\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, and therefore require less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since then. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multi-modal processing, robotics, and even playing chess.

He was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He co-authored the document that coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI), developed the programming language family Lisp, significantly influenced the design of the language ALGOL, popularized time-sharing, and invented garbage collection.\n\nSeveral Key Theme’s in McCarthy’s Work\n\n- The idea that the world can be represented symbolically for a machine and reasoned about by that machine.\n- The division of the AI problem into two parts: epistemological (representation) and heuristic (search).\n- The importance of formal (mathematical) representation, particularly the use of logic for representation.\n- The use of reification—the conceptual turning of abstract structures (such as situations) into concrete instances that can be reasoned about. The situation calculus, where the state of the universe is compressed into a single constant, is an example of such reification.\n- The development of abstract and general mechanisms (proof checkers, logic, circumscription, common sense) in contrast with domain-specific tools and languages.\n- The relatively complete analysis of artificial domains (programming languages, puzzles, chess) instead of a (necessarily) incomplete analysis of natural situations.\n- The importance of environments for interactive exploration. This is illustrated not so much by an explicit campaign position of McCarthy's as by the systems whose creation he led, such as the AI lab, Lisp, and timesharing.\n\nAwards and honors\n\n- Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (1971)\n- Kyoto Prize (1988)\n- National Medal of Science (USA) in Mathematical, Statistical, and Computational Sciences (1990)\n- Inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum ‘for his co-founding of the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and timesharing systems, and for major contributions to mathematics and computer science’. (1999)\n- Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science from the Franklin Institute (2003)\n- Inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame (2011), for the ‘significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems’.",

A superintelligence may or may not be created by an intelligence explosion and associated with a technological singularity. University of Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as ‘any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest’. \n\nTechnological researchers disagree about how likely present-day human intelligence is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of futures studies scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.\n\nSome researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence. The first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of perfect recall, a vastly superior knowledge base, and the ability to multitask in ways not possible to biological entities. This may give them the opportunity to—either as a single being or as a new species—become much more powerful than humans, and to displace them.\n\nA number of scientists and forecasters argue for prioritizing early research into the possible benefits and risks of human and machine cognitive enhancement, because of the potential social impact of such technologies in both raising the level of collective human intelligence and in intelligently ushering the age of super intelligence as a whole.",

For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (which has two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy, less uncertainty) than identifying the outcome from a roll of a die (which has six equally likely outcomes).

The name is a play on words based on the earlier concept of one-shot learning, in which classification can be learned from only one, or a few, examples.\n\nZero-shot methods generally work by associating observed and non-observed classes through some form of auxiliary information, which encodes observable distinguishing properties of objects. For example, given a set of images of animals to be classified, along with auxiliary textual descriptions of what animals look like, an artificial intelligence model which has been trained to recognize horses, but has never been given a zebra, can still recognize a zebra when it also knows that zebras look like striped horses. This problem is widely studied in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine perception.",
